    <p>As a frustrated student at Alliance University, I often found myself struggling to keep up with the demands of my classes. It seemed like no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't seem to get a handle on the material. I would spend hours studying and doing homework, but it never seemed to be enough.

      My grades began to suffer, and I started to feel like a failure. I began to doubt my own abilities and wonder if I was even cut out for this whole "student" thing. I was constantly stressed and anxious, and it started to take a toll on my mental health.</p>
